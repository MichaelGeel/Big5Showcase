This is a website that'll showcase the Big 5 of Africa (Lion, Elephant, Rhino, Cheetah and Buffalo)

Home Page:

Will be using Flexbox to manage the layout of the webpage.
Each animal will have a dedicated page with more info on it.
The home page will have a staggered presentation.
    Each animal will have a 2 sentence introduction alongside an image of the animal.
    The images will be the staggering with them alternating between being positioned on the left to the right.
    The text will wrap around the images.
The page will be responsive and if the screen approaches mobile sizes then the staggering will no longer be in affect and 
the content will be centered instead.

Individual Animal Pages re-design pending.

These pages will have a flexbox where each item contains some information along with a supporting image.
The items will all be the same size, and flex accordingly.
    At a specific size, the items will first flex ontop of eachother.
    Then at a smaller size, the item content will flex so that the text of each item sits under the supporting image.
