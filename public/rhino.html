                        Rhinoceroses inhabit a variety of environments, including savannas, grasslands, and tropical forests.
                        They require large territories with access to water and mud wallows.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Rhinos are herbivores, with their diet varying by species. Black rhinos primarily eat leafy plants,
                        branches and shoots, while White rhinos graze on grasses.

                        Rhinoceroses are generally solitary, except for mothers with young and during mating.
                        They are known for their poor eyesight but have excellent hearing and sense of smell.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Rhinos are critically endangered due to paoching for their horns and habitat loss.
                        Conservation programs include anti-poaching efforts, translocation projects, and habitat management.
