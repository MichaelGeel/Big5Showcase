                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Lions primarily inhabit savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands across sub-Saharan Africa.
                        They require large territories that provide ample prey and cover for hunting.

                    <h2 class="info-category">Diet</h2>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Lions are carnivorous and primarily hunt large herbivores such as zebras, wildebeests, and antelopes.
                        They are also known to scavenge and will eat smaller animals when larger prey is scarce.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Lions live in social groups called prides, consisting of related females, their offspring, and a small number of adult males.
                        They are known for their cooperative hunting strategies and territorial behavior.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Lions are currently listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss, human-wildlife conflicts, and poaching.
                        Conservation efforts focus on habitat protection, anti-poaching measures, and reducing human-lion conflicts.
